# Programming Street - 150
Starting from Zero in Coding - DSA is a critical Problem-Solving Skill, it's important to build a strong foundation before diving into it.

1. **PS-Sprint-1**: This sprint covers fundamental problems to help you build your basic programming skills.

2. **PS-Sprint-2**: This sprint focuses on intermediate-level problems, further strengthening your foundational skills and introducing more complex concepts.

3. **PS-Sprint-3**: This sprint includes advanced problems designed to solidify your understanding and prepare you for more challenging programming tasks.

## The Right Starting Point

1. Select a Programming Language: Begin with a language that suits your interests or industry needs Python, Java, or C++. Focus on mastering the fundamentals: syntax, control structures (loops, conditionals), variables, data types, and other core concepts. 

These are the building blocks of your coding journey.

2. Practice Essential Problems: Once youâ€™ve gained confidence in the basics, it's time to apply your knowledge by solving fundamental programming challenges. Aim to complete at least 100 to 150 exercises, including:
 - Determining Even/Odd Numbers
 - Checking for Prime Numbers
 - Validating Leap Years
 - Calculating Armstrong Numbers
 - Generating the Fibonacci Series
 - Identifying Palindromes
 - Crafting Star Patterns
 - Tackling Basic Mathematical and Logical Problems ( And Many More....... )

 And remember, as you embark on this coding adventure:

If at first you donâ€™t succeed, just remember that even a program with a million lines of code can have bugs. So, take a break, grab a coffee, and debug your way to success! After all, the only thing more persistent than a coding error is the coffee youâ€™ll need to fix it! â˜•ðŸ’»
